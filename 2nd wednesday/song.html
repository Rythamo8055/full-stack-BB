        <h3><b><big>
        I found a love for me
        Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
        Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
        Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
        'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin' what it was
        I will not give you up this time



        Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
        And in your eyes, you're holding mine
        Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
        Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
        When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
        But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"

        Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
        She shares my dreams, I hope that someday, I'll share her home
        I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
        To carry love, to carry children of our own
        We are still kids, but we're so in love, fightin' against all odds
        I know we'll be alright this time
        Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
        I see my future in your eyes

        Oh, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
        Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
        When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
        I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

        No, no, no
        Mm, oh
        Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
        Barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
        I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
        An angel in person, and she looks perfect

        Though I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight
